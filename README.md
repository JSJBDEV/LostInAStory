# Lost In A Story

_You wander through the [Carnival](https://modfest.net/carnival) striding about the stalls and stands until you reach a 
small caravan with the worn out letters "bookshop" above its door, you step inside and browse the shelves, you find a 
particulalry dusty tome and open it up, but you do not see words, the words see you._

_You find yourself lost in a story In a world of The Authors design_

## The Mod
Lost In A Story, or LIAS is a mod to be presented at the 2024 ModFest: Carnival

The mod takes inspiration from [Mystcraft](https://ftbwiki.org/Mystcraft) but with a bit of a twist, around the world you will
find and create Story Books, these books will contain the definitions of a story, for instance:

~~~
You wake up in your hometown, under attack by skeletons (wearing fancy hats)
You travel to a Desert Temple to find answers, where you find an old book
You continue to a castle, where you finally face Azajef, the Skeleton Prince
You raid his treasure chamber and live happily ever after.
~~~ 
every sentence is converted to a quest in the storytellers dimension, a dimension analogous to the overworld, but with some
noticeable differences, you are in adventure mode in this dimension, however you can find tools and enchantments to shape it 
to your will, once you complete the final "quest" of a story, you are returned to the overworld outside the book
